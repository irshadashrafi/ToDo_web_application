Project Title: To-Do List Web Application

Project Description: Create a web-based to-do list application that allows users to
manage their tasks and stay organized. This project will involve building a user interface
to add, edit, and mark tasks as completed. It's a great way for beginners to learn about
web development using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and potentially a backend technology
like Node.js.

Features you can include:

1)Task Management: Enable users to add, edit, and delete tasks on the to-do list.
2)Task Status: Allow users to mark tasks as completed or pending.
3)User Interface: Design a user-friendly interface with sections for adding tasks,
displaying the task list, and managing tasks.
4)Storage: Store tasks in the browser's local storage to persist data across sessions.
5)Priority Levels: Implement priority levels (e.g., high, medium, low) for tasks to help
users organize their to-do list.
6)Filtering and Sorting: Provide options to filter tasks by status (completed/pending)
and sort tasks by priority or due date.
7)Responsive Design: Ensure the application is responsive and works well on various
screen sizes.
